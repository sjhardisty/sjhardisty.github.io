---

hello, I am a graduate student at oregon state university interested in computational research methods to answer ecological questions. I'm originally from Seattle and in my freetime enjoy reading and hiking. 

Current projects include:

Species Distribution Models of the ghost shrimp, <i> Neotrypaea gigas </i> 

Sediment microbial diversity associated with the shrimp burrows.
